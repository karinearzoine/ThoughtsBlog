Hello readers ! It's my first time putting my thoughts into words. I am excited to start this journey with you, but I am also very nervous. I hope you will enjoy it. 

Here it is. 

####[Lupus ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus){:target="_blank"}
At the age of 15, I've developed some dermatological problems on my face, mainly cheeks, and chest. I would get inter alia big red spots that could take days to leave and experienced extreme fatigue and stress. After seeing many doctors, I was diagnost with lupus. However, it still didn't make any sense to me because it didn't explain some of my other symptoms.

In January 2014, it really started to get bad. I was tired all the time, I couldn't concentrate in class, I was more moody than ever, I've developed hormonal dysfunctions, knee arthritis and I was so swollen that sometimes it got hard to breath, let alone get dressed. I stayed that way until June hoping it'll pass. I had to see a picture of myself to realize that something was wrong with my body and it wasn't lupus causing it. 

My approach was to look at the big picture, something doctors didn't do when I was a teenager. I wrote down all my symptoms and everything I thought wasn't right with my body. I was determined to find the illness that would explain them all. 

That's when I started doing some research on the web. At first, I was looking into serious immune diseases thinking that it must be it. However, my instinct told me it was something much more simple than this. 
So, I went back to the basics. I looked at my environment and the food I was eating. 

####[Lactose intolerance ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance){:target="_blank"}
I stop eating lactose for a week. Although I was feeling a little better, it wasn't it. 


####[IBS ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome){:target="_blank"}
It explained some symptoms, but not all of them, it wasn't so. 


####[Celiac disease ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease){:target="_blank"}
As I read through the list of symptoms, I could recognize myself. After so much research, I asked myself: could this really be it? I sent the list to the people who knew me best i.e. my parents and my boyfriend. We all came to the same conclusion: it explained it all. 

That's how I discovered that, all my life, the answer was right in front of me. For so many years I poisoned myself eating gluten. It also caused me to develop a lactose intolerance. 

My lesson for you is **listen to your body. You are your best doctor.** Be aware of your body and how it responds to your environment. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you.
