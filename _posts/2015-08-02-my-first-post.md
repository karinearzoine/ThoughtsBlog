###Hello everyone! 
It is my first time putting my thoughts in writing. I am excited to start this journey with you guys but I am also very nervous. I hope you will enjoy it. 

Here it is. 

At the age of 15, I've develop some dermatological problems on my face, mainly cheeks and eyes, and cheast. I would get these big red spots that could take days to leave. After seeing many doctors, I was diagnost with [lupus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus). It still didn't make any sens because it didn't explain all my symptoms.

In January 2014, it really started to get bad. I was tired all the time, I couldn't concentrate in class, I was more moody than ever, I've develop hormonal disfonctions and I was so swollen that sometimes it got hard to breath, let alone get dressed. I stayed that way until June hoping it'll pass. I had to see a picture of myself to realize that something was wrong with my body and it wasn't lupus causing it. 

My approche was to look at the big picture, something doctors didn't do when I was a teenager. I wrote down all my symptoms and everything I thought wasn't right with my body. I was determine to find the illness that would explain them all. 

That's when I started doing some research on the web. At first, I was looking into immune diseases that were very serious thinking that it must be it. However, my instinct told me it was something much more simple than this. 
So, I went back to the basics. I looked at my environment and the food I was eating. 

[Lactose intolerence ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance)
: I stop eating lactose for a week. Although I was feeling a little better, it wasn't it. 


[IBS ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome)
: It explained some symptoms but not all of them, so it wasn't it. 


 [Celiac disease ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease)
: As I read through the symptoms, I could recognize myself. After so much research, I asked myself: could this really be it? I sent the list of symptoms to the people who knew me best i.e. my parents and my boyfriend. We all came to the same conclusion: it explained it all. 

That's how I discovered that all my life, the answer way right infront of me. For so many years I poisoned myself eating gluten. It also caused me to develop a lactose intolerence. 

My lesson is **listen to your body. You are your best doctor.** Be aware of your body and how it responds to your environment. Sometimes the answer is right infront of you.
