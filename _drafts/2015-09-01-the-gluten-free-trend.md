So... here's the deal ! 

Last year, when I eliminated gluten from my diet, I had to read and search every label, every list of ingredients in order to figure out if the packaged food I was buying contrained gluten.
As the year went on, I started noticing that more and more compagnies would label their products gluten free.
I even noticed that there was this special gluten free certification on some of them. 

So, I started to enjoy myself again! I could eat bread, pasta, cookies, cereals and everything I enjoyed (as long as it was dairy free)! Therefor, I stopped reading the list of ingredients and started looking for the gluten free certification. 

However, one morning, I asked myself what is this bread I'm eating made of? Perhaps I should read the list of ingredients and try to replicate it! I could bake it myself! You need to know that one of my ultimate passion is cooking and, very often, I would bake loafs of bread for my family. 
The list was endless! I couldn't recognize most of the ingredients! That's when I realized how unhealthy the gluten free food was! 

The gluten free diet became a trend! People think that they'll loose weight or eat healthier. What they don't know is that they might not eat wheat, which could be fatning, but they eat chemicals and other oats that are as fatning as wheat.
