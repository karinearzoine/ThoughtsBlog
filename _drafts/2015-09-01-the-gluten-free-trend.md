So... here's the deal

Last year, when I eliminated gluten from my diet, I had to read and search very carefully every list of ingredients in order to figure out if the packaged food I was buying contrained gluten.

As the year went on, I noticed that more and more compagnies would label their products gluten free. I even discovered that there was this special gluten free certification on some of them. 

So, I started to enjoy myself again! I could eat bread, pasta, cookies, cereals and everything I enjoyed (as long as it was dairy free)! Therefor,I stopped reading the list of ingredients and I would only buy certified gluten free packaged food.

You need to know that one of my ultimate passion is cooking and, before I became gluten-free, I would bake loafs of bread for my family. 
One morning, I asked myself what is this bread that I'm eating made of? Perhaps I should read the list of ingredients and try to replicate it! I could bake it myself!
The list was endless! I couldn't recognize most of the ingredients! That's when I realized how unhealthy the gluten free food was! 

The gluten free diet became a trend! People think that they'll loose weight and eat healthier. What they don't know is that they might not eat wheat, which could be fatning at some extend, but they eat chemicals and other oats that are as fatning as wheat.

I'm not the one to tell anyone I meet that I am gluten-free, so whenever I hear people say they are gluten free and feel "SO much healthier" it makes me laugh. I just can't understand why one would restain to such a painfull diet if it was not necessary. 

"Cheap mass production, durability and long shelf-life are more important than the effects of foods on health. The biggest industries are usually able to keep public attention away from the harm they do."-Dr. Peat, Milk in context: allergies, ecology, and some myths

After becoming aware of the crap (excuse my word) I was eating, I stopped all gluten-free food. Slow carbs are not essential nutrients in our daily diet, therefor, I compensate by eating more fruit, vegetables and meat.

Being healthy doesn't mean being on a diet, it means avoiding food that are hard for you to digest, avoid processed food, excercise and live a happy life.
