#####This month marks my one year post-diagnosis. 
#####It has been an incredibly hard, but amazingly rewarding year.

At first, I felt relief and optimist about my diagnosis. I didn't think it would be hard to change my lifestyle. I thought: "Ah, I just need to cut off bread and cheese!" Little did I know it wasn't that simple.

It took me a few months of testing before becoming completely gluten free. I had no idea that some prepackaged sauces contained gluten. After getting contaminated with sauces and other food like rice noodles, I started reading carefully the list of ingredients to make sure the food I was eating didn't contain any. 

I would sometimes forget that I couldn't eat it. For example, my mom made couscous and I ate so much of it, it's once I finished eating that I realized what I've just done. I spent the next 3 days sick in bed.

<ins>I was hungry all the time !</ins>
<p>Bread and cheese had so much importance in my diet that, once I needed to eliminated them, I couldn't think of anything else to eat. I would cook rice or potatoes every morning to make sure that if I would get hungry, I'd have something to eat. I also started eating a lot of chips. It didn't make me feel so good about myself. </p>
<p>I was in denial and some days, I wouldn't want to eat anything because I was mad about my condition and the constraints I had. </p>

<ins>I would think about it all the time!</ins> 
<p>I would always complain: "I want pizza, bagel with cream cheese and alfredo pasta!" It made things harder. </p>

Now, I enjoy how I eat and the well-being it provides. Instead of thinking about how tasty gluten and dairy meals are, I think about how poorly I felt when I would eat them and it puts me off.  

What kept me going was that each week, I would feel more and more like a regular 21 year old. The first thing I noticed was that with each passing day, the swelling reduced, I was able to concentrate much better in class and I wasn't tired all the time anymore. 

I am very careful about what I eat and where I eat. If I'm invited to a party,I eat at home prior to the party and once I'm there, I will only eat raw vegetables or food that I know for sure doesn't contain any. I'd rather be safe than sorry! I really don't enjoy getting sick from cross-contamination. 

My lesson for you is **fix a goal and do everything in your power to achieve it! It might be hard, but the reward is much greater that the effort.**
