This month marks the one year of my new gluten-lactose free life. It has been an increadibly hard but amazing year.

It took me a few months of testing before becoming completly gluten-free. For exemple, I had no idea that in some prepackaged sauces, there was gluten. 
Or, at first, I would forget that I couldn't eat it.
